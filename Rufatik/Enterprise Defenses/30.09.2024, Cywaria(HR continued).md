In Sysmon (System Monitor), Event IDs help track various system activities, such as process creation, file modifications, network connections, etc. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of **Sysmon Event ID 1** and **Sysmon Event ID 11**:

### **Sysmon Event ID 1: Process Creation**

- **Description**: This event logs when a process is created on the system. It is one of the most useful events for detecting suspicious or malicious activity, as it records critical details about the process execution.
  
- **Details Captured**:
  - **Process GUID**: A globally unique identifier for the process.
  - **Process ID**: The process ID (PID) of the newly created process.
  - **Image**: The full path to the executable that was launched.
  - **Command Line**: The command-line arguments used to launch the process.
  - **User**: The account that started the process.
  - **Parent Process GUID**: The GUID of the parent process.
  - **Parent Process ID**: The PID of the parent process.
  - **Parent Image**: The executable that launched the process (parent process).
  - **Parent Command Line**: The command-line arguments used to launch the parent process.
  - **Hashes**: The hash of the image file (if configured).
  - **Integrity Level**: The integrity level (e.g., high, medium) of the process.
  - **Authentication ID**: Associated with the session the process is part of.
  - **Logon ID**: An ID that links the process to a specific user session.

- **Use Case**: This event is critical for monitoring process creation, which is often associated with malware, lateral movement, and post-exploitation activities. By examining the command line and parent-child relationships, analysts can detect suspicious activities such as:
  - Malicious PowerShell commands.
  - Unusual parent-child process relationships (e.g., `cmd.exe` launching suspicious executables).
  - Execution of unsigned binaries or suspicious programs.

Process Create:
UtcTime: 2024-09-25 12:34:56
ProcessGuid: {abcd1234-ef56-7890-gh12-ijkl3456mn78}
ProcessId: 1234

CommandLine: "C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe" "C:\Users\Public\readme.txt"
User: EXAMPLE-DOMAIN\JohnDoe
ParentProcessGuid: {abcd5678-ef12-3456-gh78-ijkl9012mn34}
ParentProcessId: 4321
ParentImage: C:\Windows\explorer.exe
Hashes: MD5=5D41402ABC4B2A76B9719D911017C592
```

### **Sysmon Event ID 11: File Creation (on removable media)**

- **Description**: This event logs whenever a file is created on a removable media device, such as a USB drive. This is particularly useful for detecting unauthorized data exfiltration or file copying to external drives.
  
- **Details Captured**:
  - **File Name**: The full path of the file that was created.
  - **Creation UtcTime**: The time the file was created.
  - **Process ID**: The process that created the file.
  - **Process GUID**: A globally unique identifier for the process.
  - **User**: The user who created the file.
  - **Hashes**: The hash of the file (if configured).

- **Use Case**: Monitoring for unauthorized or suspicious file creations on removable media is critical for detecting potential data theft, insider threats, or malware that uses USB drives for propagation. Event ID 11 helps security teams to track:
  - Sensitive files copied to external devices.
  - Suspicious activity around removable media devices being plugged into the system.
  - Unauthorized file transfers by users.

#### Example:
```plaintext
File created on removable media:
UtcTime: 2024-09-25 14:15:22
ProcessGuid: {abcd1234-ef56-7890-gh12-ijkl3456mn78}
ProcessId: 5678
Image: C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe
TargetFilename: E:\SensitiveData\confidential.docx
CreationUtcTime: 2024-09-25 14:15:20
User: EXAMPLE-DOMAIN\JohnDoe
Hashes: MD5=5D41402ABC4B2A76B9719D911017C592
```

### Summary:
- **Sysmon Event ID 1**: Tracks **process creation** with detailed information about the executed process and its parent, which is essential for detecting process-based attacks or anomalies.
- **Sysmon Event ID 11**: Monitors **file creation on removable media**, useful for detecting potential data exfiltration or suspicious file transfers to external devices.

Both events are crucial for detecting malicious behavior and insider threats in enterprise environments.
