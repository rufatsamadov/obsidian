Kerberoasting is a sophisticated post-compromise attack technique that targets service accounts within Microsoft Active Directory environments. This method is particularly effective because it allows attackers to extract password hashes of service accounts, which are often highly privileged and have access to sensitive data.

By leveraging the Kerberos authentication protocol, attackers can request service tickets for accounts with Service Principal Names (SPNs). These tickets are then used to obtain the password hashes, which can be cracked offline. Once the plaintext credentials are obtained, the attacker can impersonate the service account, gaining unauthorized access to critical systems and data.

## How does Kerberoasting Work?

Kerberoasting operates by exploiting the Kerberos authentication protocol, specifically targeting service accounts with Service Principal Names (SPNs). The attacker first compromises a domain user account, which is then used to request a service ticket from the Ticket Granting Service (TGS). This service ticket is encrypted with the hash of the service account's password.

Once the service ticket is obtained, the attacker extracts the ticket's hash and proceeds to crack it offline using tools like Hashcat or John the Ripper. This offline cracking process is crucial as it allows the attacker to avoid detection by security systems that monitor network traffic and user activity. The cracked password hash can then be used to impersonate the service account, granting the attacker unauthorized access to network resources.

## What are Examples of Kerberoasting?

Examples of Kerberoasting attacks highlight the technique's effectiveness in real-world scenarios. One notable instance is the **Operation Wocao**, where threat actors used PowerSploit’s Invoke-Kerberoast module to request encrypted service tickets and brute-force the passwords of Windows Service Accounts offline. This allowed them to authenticate as service accounts on other systems within the network, facilitating further malicious activities.

Another significant example is the **Solorigate Backdoor Incident**, where APT29 threat actors obtained Ticket Granting Service (TGS) tickets for Active Directory Service Principal Names (SPNs) and cracked them offline. This method enabled unauthorized access to sensitive systems and data. Similarly, the **FIN7 Threat Group** utilized Kerberoasting to extract service tickets and crack passwords, allowing them to move laterally within the network and access critical credentials.

==I said : topic ic kerberos and its attacks==

Kerberos is a network authentication protocol designed to provide secure authentication over non-secure networks. It was developed by MIT as part of Project Athena and is widely used in enterprise environments, particularly in Windows domains. Here's an overview of how Kerberos works and some common attacks against it:

### How Kerberos Works

1. **Authentication Server (AS):** The client requests authentication from the Authentication Server. The AS verifies the client's identity using a shared secret (usually a password).
   
2. **Ticket-Granting Ticket (TGT):** If the client's identity is verified, the AS issues a Ticket-Granting Ticket (TGT). The TGT is encrypted with the Key Distribution Center’s (KDC) secret key and is valid for a limited period. This ticket proves the user's identity to the Ticket-Granting Server (TGS).

3. **Ticket-Granting Server (TGS):** The client then presents the TGT to the TGS, which issues service tickets for access to specific services within the network (e.g., file servers, databases). The service ticket is encrypted with the service’s secret key.

4. **Service Request:** The client presents the service ticket to the appropriate server to gain access to the requested service. The service server decrypts the ticket, verifies its validity, and grants access to the resource.

### Kerberos Attacks

1. **Pass-the-Ticket Attack:**
   - In this attack, an attacker captures valid Kerberos tickets (TGT or service tickets) from memory or the network and reuses them to gain unauthorized access to network resources.
   - **Defense:** Implement strong encryption and monitoring for unusual authentication patterns or repeated ticket use from different systems.

2. **Kerberoasting:**
   - This attack targets service accounts with weak passwords. The attacker requests a service ticket from the TGS for a target service. The ticket is encrypted with the service account's NTLM hash. The attacker can then brute-force the service account's password offline using the captured ticket.
   - **Defense:** Use strong passwords for service accounts, enforce password policies, and monitor for abnormal ticket requests.

3. **Golden Ticket Attack:**
   - A golden ticket is a forged TGT that allows an attacker to impersonate any user, including domain admins. This is possible if an attacker obtains the Kerberos Key Distribution Center’s (KDC) master key (KRBTGT account hash), which encrypts TGTs.
   - **Defense:** Secure the KRBTGT account and monitor its usage. Regularly reset the KRBTGT password, though this can be a complex process.

4. **Silver Ticket Attack:**
   - In a silver ticket attack, an attacker forges service tickets instead of TGTs. With the hash of a service account, an attacker can generate valid service tickets and gain unauthorized access to services without needing a valid TGT.
   - **Defense:** Strengthen service account passwords, monitor for abnormal service ticket requests, and limit service account privileges.

5. **AS-REP Roasting:**
   - Similar to Kerberoasting, but instead of targeting service accounts, this attack exploits user accounts that don’t require pre-authentication. When pre-authentication is disabled, an attacker can request an AS-REP and receive data encrypted with the user's password hash, which can be brute-forced offline.
   - **Defense:** Enforce pre-authentication for all user accounts and monitor for unusual AS-REP requests.

6. **Overpass-the-Hash (Pass-the-Key):**
   - Instead of using a Kerberos ticket, this attack uses a user's NTLM hash to request a TGT from the KDC, allowing the attacker to gain access to services as the legitimate user.
   - **Defense:** Implement credential guard mechanisms, restrict the use of NTLM where possible, and monitor for suspicious authentication requests.

### Best Practices to Defend Against Kerberos Attacks

1. **Strong Password Policies:** Enforce strong, complex passwords for both user and service accounts to make brute-force attacks harder.
2. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Adding MFA helps reduce the risk of ticket-related attacks by requiring an additional authentication factor.
3. **Regularly Rotate Service Account Passwords:** Frequently changing passwords of privileged accounts limits the impact of attacks like Kerberoasting or golden ticket attacks.
4. **Audit and Monitoring:** Implement logging and monitoring for suspicious activities such as unusual ticket requests, repeated authentication attempts, or service access anomalies.
5. **Least Privilege Access:** Ensure that service accounts and users have only the necessary permissions they require to reduce the attack surface.

Kerberos is generally secure, but like any protocol, it can be exploited if misconfigured or weak passwords are used. Understanding these attacks and defenses is crucial for maintaining a secure environment.

==I said : can a user that doesnt have spn value request service ticket from TGS and if he can how he implement this?==

A **user account** that **doesn't have an SPN (Service Principal Name)** associated with it can still request a **service ticket** from the Ticket-Granting Server (TGS), but only to access services that have SPNs defined. The user account itself doesn't need to have an SPN to request service tickets for services like file shares, web services, or database access.

To clarify the flow:

1. **SPNs are associated with service accounts,** not user accounts.
   - An SPN is a unique identifier for a service instance (e.g., an HTTP service, MSSQL service) and helps the Kerberos system identify which account a service ticket should be issued for.
   - Services like web servers, database servers, or file servers have SPNs, which allow users to request tickets to access them.

2. **User Requests Service Ticket from TGS:**
   - When a user wants to access a service (e.g., HTTP or MSSQL), they send a request to the TGS for a **service ticket**.
   - The user specifies the SPN of the target service in the ticket request (for example, `HTTP/server.domain.com` for a web service).
   - The TGS generates a service ticket, encrypts it with the service account's secret (the account associated with the SPN), and sends it back to the user.

### Scenario Where User Doesn't Have an SPN

- **Step-by-Step Process Without User SPN:**
   1. **User Authenticates with the KDC (AS Exchange):** 
      - The user authenticates using their username and password with the Authentication Server (AS) part of the Key Distribution Center (KDC) and receives a **Ticket-Granting Ticket (TGT)**.
   
   2. **Requesting Service Ticket (TGS Exchange):**
      - The user decides to access a specific service (e.g., a web application or database).
      - The user **sends the TGT to the TGS** and requests a service ticket, providing the SPN of the service they want to access.
      - The user does not need to have an SPN in their account for this process to work. They only need to know the SPN of the service they want to use.
   
   3. **Receiving Service Ticket:**
      - The TGS checks the user's TGT and issues a service ticket if valid. It encrypts part of the ticket with the service account's secret, and part of it with the user's session key.
      - The user receives the service ticket and presents it to the service for access.

### How This is Implemented by the User

1. **User Does Not Require SPN:** 
   - The user just needs to authenticate against the KDC, receive their TGT, and then request service tickets for services using the correct SPN.

2. **Using Tools (for example):**
   - On a Windows domain, a user might use the command-line tool `klist` to list their TGT and service tickets or use PowerShell to request service tickets.

   Example: 
   ```bash
   klist tgt
   ```
   - This command will show the TGT the user received after authenticating.

3. **Requesting Service Tickets (Example using PowerShell or Linux):**
   - If the user wants to access a web service with SPN `HTTP/server.domain.com`, they request the ticket from TGS:
   ```bash
   kvno HTTP/server.domain.com
   ```
   - This command requests a service ticket from the TGS for the service identified by the SPN `HTTP/server.domain.com`.

4. **Presenting the Ticket:**
   - Once the service ticket is received, the user presents it to the service (such as through a web browser accessing a protected web application, or by using SSH to access a server).

### Important Points

- The **user account itself doesn’t need an SPN** because it's not acting as a service; it's simply a regular user account requesting access to services.
- **SPNs are critical for the service accounts**, as they allow the Kerberos protocol to issue tickets that can be understood by the service (by matching the service's secret with the SPN).
  
In summary, a user **does not need an SPN** to request service tickets; they just need to know the SPN of the service they want to access. The SPN is only important for the service accounts to receive and decrypt service tickets.

==-In kerberoasting attack,is the service ticket encrypted with service accoun's password's hash?==
==Answer:==
Yes, in a **Kerberoasting attack**, the service ticket is encrypted with the hash of the **service account's password**.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of the process:

1. **Service Ticket Generation**: When a user requests access to a service on the network (like a file server), the user must first obtain a **service ticket** (TGS ticket) from the **Key Distribution Center (KDC)**. The KDC issues this service ticket by encrypting it with the hash of the service account's password, typically using **RC4**, **AES**, or another encryption algorithm based on the configured settings.

2. **Attack Exploitation**: In a Kerberoasting attack, an attacker who has already authenticated to the domain can request service tickets for **any service** on the network. These tickets are encrypted using the hash of the service account's password.

3. **Offline Cracking**: The attacker can then extract the encrypted portion of the service ticket and perform **offline brute-force** or dictionary attacks to try and recover the **service account's password** by cracking the ticket.

Since the ticket is encrypted with the **service account password hash**, if the attacker can successfully crack it, they gain access to the service account credentials. This is particularly dangerous when targeting high-privilege accounts such as those running **SQL services** or other critical services in an Active Directory environment.


***

Let's break down the ==**Kerberoasting attack**== step by step to understand how it works, why it happens, and how attackers can exploit it.

### 1. **Background on Kerberos Authentication**
Kerberos is a widely used authentication protocol in **Windows domains**. It uses **tickets** to allow users to access resources securely without needing to send passwords over the network.

Here’s a simplified view of the Kerberos process:
- **Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT)**: When a user logs in, they authenticate to the **Key Distribution Center (KDC)** (usually a domain controller) and receive a **TGT**, which is encrypted with the KDC’s secret key.
- **Service Ticket (TGS)**: When the user needs to access a network service (like a file server, SQL server, etc.), they send their TGT to the KDC to request a **Service Ticket**. This Service Ticket is encrypted with the **service account’s password hash** and is what the service itself will use to verify the user’s access.
  
This process helps prevent passwords from being sent directly over the network. However, there’s a weakness here that Kerberoasting exploits.

---

### 2. **Kerberoasting Attack Overview**
Kerberoasting is an attack that allows an attacker, who is already authenticated within the network (usually with low-level privileges), to steal **service account credentials** by cracking the encrypted **service tickets**. The steps are as follows:

#### 1. **Attacker Authentication**
The attacker must have access to the domain network, which means they need a legitimate user account. This could be any low-level account.

#### 2. **Requesting Service Tickets (TGS)**
The attacker identifies services running on the network that are associated with service accounts (these could be services like SQL Server, IIS, etc.). The attacker requests a **Service Ticket (TGS)** from the KDC for these services. This can be done with the `Request Service Ticket` feature of the Kerberos protocol.

- **Service Tickets are encrypted** with the **service account’s password hash** (which can be an NTLM or Kerberos hash, depending on the encryption type in use). This is a key detail: since the ticket is encrypted with the service account password hash, if the attacker can crack the ticket, they recover the **service account’s password**.

#### 3. **Extracting Service Tickets**
Once the Service Ticket (TGS) is issued by the KDC, the attacker can extract this ticket from memory or network traffic (e.g., by using tools like **Mimikatz** or **Rubeus**). This ticket is encrypted with the service account’s password hash.

#### 4. **Offline Password Cracking**
The attacker then takes the encrypted service ticket and performs **offline brute-force or dictionary attacks** to crack the encryption and recover the service account password.

- The cracking can be done using tools like **John the Ripper** or **Hashcat**, which can perform a brute-force attack against the service ticket using precomputed wordlists, guessing possible passwords, or using GPU-based cracking.

#### 5. **Compromising the Service Account**
Once the password hash is cracked, the attacker now has the **plaintext password** of the service account.

- Many service accounts in enterprise environments often have elevated privileges, especially if the service account belongs to high-privilege services like a **SQL Server** or **IIS service**. These accounts can sometimes even be domain administrators.
- By compromising the service account, the attacker gains access to all resources associated with that account.

---

### 3. **Detailed Attack Workflow**

Here’s a more detailed step-by-step breakdown of how a **Kerberoasting attack** would look from start to finish:

#### **Step 1: Initial Network Access**
- The attacker gains initial access to the network using a compromised low-privilege account. This can be done through **phishing**, **exploiting weak passwords**, or any other method.
  
#### **Step 2: Enumeration of Service Principal Names (SPNs)**
- The attacker enumerates the service accounts in the Active Directory domain. This is typically done by querying the **Service Principal Names (SPNs)**, which map services to their associated service accounts.
  
- **SPN** is a unique identifier that Kerberos uses to associate a service instance with a service logon account. The attacker runs commands like `setspn -T <Domain> -Q */*` or uses tools like **PowerShell** or **Rubeus** to identify all SPNs in the network. These SPNs represent services that can be targeted in the attack.

#### **Step 3: Request Service Tickets (TGS) for SPNs**
- After identifying the SPNs, the attacker sends a request to the KDC for service tickets corresponding to these SPNs.
  
- The KDC responds by issuing the **TGS (service ticket)**. This ticket is encrypted with the **service account’s password hash**. The attacker doesn’t need to provide any special privileges to request these tickets—any authenticated domain user can request them.

#### **Step 4: Extracting TGS Tickets**
- The attacker extracts these **TGS service tickets** from memory using tools like **Mimikatz** or **Rubeus**. These tools allow the attacker to extract the ticket directly from the Windows security subsystem (LSASS) or cache.

#### **Step 5: Offline Cracking of Service Ticket**
- Now the attacker has the encrypted service tickets. They use **offline password-cracking tools** like **Hashcat** or **John the Ripper** to attempt to crack the encryption by brute-forcing the service account’s password.

- If the password of the service account is weak (like "P@ssw0rd!" or some easily guessable password), the cracking process can succeed in a short time.

#### **Step 6: Gaining Access with Service Account**
- Once the password is cracked, the attacker gains access to the **plaintext password** of the service account. The attacker can now log in using this account and escalate their privileges depending on what permissions the service account has.

---

### 4. **Key Points of Exploitation**
- **Weak passwords**: Kerberoasting is especially effective against service accounts with **weak passwords**. If the password is strong, it will be much harder for the attacker to crack.
- **High-privilege accounts**: Many service accounts are highly privileged in an organization, sometimes even holding **domain administrator** privileges.
- **Offline cracking**: The attack does not rely on interacting with the domain controller or the network after extracting the service ticket. All the cracking is done **offline**, meaning it’s difficult for detection tools to notice the attack.

---

### 5. **Defenses Against Kerberoasting**
To mitigate the risks posed by Kerberoasting, organizations can take several steps:

1. **Strong Passwords for Service Accounts**:
   - Use long, complex passwords for service accounts. Ideally, these passwords should be **at least 25 characters long** to make brute-forcing impractical.
   
2. **Managed Service Accounts (MSAs)**:
   - Use **Managed Service Accounts (MSAs)** or **Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSAs)**, which are automatically managed by the domain controller. These accounts have long, random passwords that are frequently rotated, making them much harder to crack.

3. **Limit Service Account Privileges**:
   - Follow the principle of **least privilege**. Make sure service accounts only have the permissions they need to function. Avoid giving service accounts **Domain Admin** privileges unless absolutely necessary.

4. **Monitor Kerberos Traffic**:
   - Implement logging and monitoring for suspicious Kerberos activity. Tools like **Windows Event Logs** and **SIEM systems** can help detect when unusual requests for service tickets are made, especially from non-privileged accounts.

5. **Ticket Lifetime Management**:
   - Set **shorter lifetimes** for service tickets to limit the time an attacker has to crack them.

---

### 6. **Common Tools for Kerberoasting**
- **Mimikatz**: Can be used to extract Kerberos tickets from memory.
- **Rubeus**: A C# tool that can request and extract service tickets, commonly used for Kerberoasting.
- **Impacket**: Python scripts that include capabilities for requesting and analyzing Kerberos tickets.
- **John the Ripper / Hashcat**: Password-cracking tools used to brute-force the service tickets and recover the service account password.

---

### Conclusion
Kerberoasting is a dangerous attack that targets weaknesses in service account management within an Active Directory environment. By taking advantage of how Kerberos encrypts service tickets, attackers can escalate their privileges by cracking weak service account passwords. Proper defenses like using strong passwords, service account management, and monitoring can help mitigate the risk.
