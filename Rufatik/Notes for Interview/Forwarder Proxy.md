Purpose of Forwarder Proxy

Based on the provided search results, a forwarder proxy serves the following purposes:

- **Corporate Privacy**: It obscures the internal structure of a corporate network, making it harder for attackers to map and identify vulnerabilities for exploitation. By routing all web traffic through the proxy, it conceals internal IP addresses and network configurations.
- **Policy Enforcement**: A forwarder proxy enforces policies on internal users, regulating their access to the internet and ensuring compliance with organizational security guidelines.
- **Single Point of Exit**: It is the single point of exit for subnet users who want to access resources outside of their private network, providing a controlled gateway for internet traffic.
- **MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) Proxy**: In some cases, forwarder proxies, like Forwarder, are used for debugging, intercepting, and manipulating HTTP traffic, making them suitable for development and testing environments.

In summary, the primary purpose of a forwarder proxy is to provide privacy, enforce policies, and regulate internet access for internal users, while also serving as a controlled gateway for external traffic.
