A normal user can log on to Active Directory (AD) using their domain credentials. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how this process works:

### 1. **User Credentials Entry**

- The user starts the logon process by pressing **Ctrl + Alt + Delete** (on a Windows machine) or simply entering their credentials (username and password) on the Windows login screen.
- The user enters their **username** (usually in the format `domain\username` or `username@domain.com`) and **password**.

### 2. **Authentication Request to the Domain Controller (DC)**

- The client computer sends the user's credentials to the **Domain Controller** (DC) using the **Kerberos** or **NTLM** authentication protocol, depending on the environment setup:
    - **Kerberos** is the default protocol for AD environments (starting with Windows 2000).
    - **NTLM** is used in scenarios where Kerberos cannot be applied (e.g., legacy systems or when the DC is unreachable).

### 3. **Validation by Domain Controller**

- The **Domain Controller** verifies the user's credentials:
    - For **Kerberos**, the DC generates a **Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT)** if the credentials are valid.
    - For **NTLM**, the DC verifies the credentials by comparing them to stored information (password hash or credentials stored in AD).

### 4. **Authorization and Access Rights**

- If the credentials are valid, the DC checks the user's **Group Memberships** and **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** to determine what resources they are authorized to access.
- The DC then responds to the client with the necessary authentication tickets or tokens (e.g., a **Kerberos service ticket**).

### 5. **User Logon**

- The client machine accepts the authentication response from the DC, and the user is logged in.
- The **Group Policy** settings for the user and computer are applied during this logon process.

### Example Login Scenario:

- A user "JohnDoe" enters the domain credentials `contoso\JohnDoe` and password at the Windows login screen.
- The credentials are sent to the AD Domain Controller, where the Kerberos protocol verifies the credentials.
- Once verified, JohnDoe is granted access, and Group Policy Objects (GPOs) are applied.

This is how a normal user (not a service account) typically logs on to Active Directory. The system ensures authentication (verifying identity) and authorization (determining access).

![GPT](https://files.oaiusercontent.com/file-xYaHQnwIGyIdzRgHGPHGrFn8?se=2124-05-01T15%3A25%3A35Z&sp=r&sv=2023-11-03&sr=b&rscc=max-age%3D1209600%2C%20immutable&rscd=attachment%3B%20filename%3DCleanShot%25202024-05-25%2520at%252017.20.25%25402x.png&sig=nhaVGEcnQZIu4DfeZdrQrAMAHSpWyLG/lx58BCtle4w%3D)

In **Kerberos authentication**, there are significant differences between the logon process for **normal users** (human accounts) and **service accounts** (automated accounts used for running services or applications). These differences mainly revolve around how they authenticate and the way their tickets are used.

Here’s a breakdown of the key differences:

### 1. **Purpose and Usage**

- **Normal Users' Logon:**
    - **Purpose:** Used by human users to authenticate and access domain resources like files, applications, or network services.
    - **Usage:** These accounts are tied to individual users and their personal sessions on machines.
- **Service Accounts' Logon:**
    - **Purpose:** Used by services, applications, or background tasks to authenticate themselves to other services (e.g., databases, web services).
    - **Usage:** Service accounts are often used by Windows services or scheduled tasks that need continuous access to resources without user intervention.

### 2. **Interactive vs Non-Interactive Logon**

- **Normal Users' Logon:**
    - **Interactive Logon:** A normal user typically performs an **interactive logon**, meaning they physically or remotely (e.g., RDP) enter credentials to log in.
    - They receive a **Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT)**, which allows them to request service tickets for accessing resources like file shares, applications, or printers.
- **Service Accounts' Logon:**
    - **Non-Interactive Logon:** A service account performs a **non-interactive logon**. This means the service logs on in the background without requiring user input (no keyboard or GUI interaction).
    - The service account also gets a TGT, but it often uses **Kerberos delegation** or **constrained delegation** to allow it to authenticate on behalf of users or other services.

### 3. **Ticket Handling**

- **Normal Users' Logon:**
    - **TGT (Ticket-Granting Ticket):** When a user logs in, they get a TGT that is valid for a specific time (default is 10 hours), allowing them to request service tickets to access domain resources.
    - The TGT is tied to the user’s session, and once the session is logged off, the TGT is discarded.
- **Service Accounts' Logon:**
    - **Persistent Tickets:** Service accounts typically have long-running sessions and need to constantly authenticate to different resources. The TGT is often renewed automatically to avoid disruption in service.
    - **Service Tickets:** Service accounts frequently request service tickets to authenticate to other domain services. If the service account has **delegation** enabled, it can request service tickets on behalf of users (for example, web servers acting on behalf of users).

### 4. **Password Handling**

- **Normal Users' Logon:**
    - The user manually enters their **password** to authenticate against the Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC), which generates a TGT.
    - Password policies apply to these users (e.g., expiration, complexity requirements).
- **Service Accounts' Logon:**
    - **Managed Passwords:** Service accounts often use **Managed Service Accounts (MSAs)**, which are special accounts where the system automatically handles password rotation and complexity requirements. This ensures they don’t require manual password changes and reduces the risk of service disruption due to password expiration.
    - **Keytab Files:** In non-Windows environments, service accounts might use **keytab** files, which store credentials (in an encrypted format) so services can authenticate without needing a password.

### 5. **Kerberos Delegation**

- **Normal Users' Logon:**
    - Normal users typically don’t need to delegate their credentials. They authenticate to the services directly and receive a service ticket that allows them access.
- **Service Accounts' Logon:**
    - **Kerberos Delegation** allows a service account to act on behalf of a user. This is common in environments where a front-end service (like a web server) needs to authenticate users to a back-end service (like a database). Service accounts can have:
        - **Unconstrained Delegation:** The service account can impersonate users to any service.
        - **Constrained Delegation:** The service account can only delegate user credentials to specific services (this is more secure).

### 6. **Security and Privileges**

- **Normal Users' Logon:**
    - Normal users generally have fewer privileges and are subject to more stringent security policies (e.g., password complexity, account lockout, etc.).
    - They are authenticated for short periods and typically do not have persistent authentication tokens.
- **Service Accounts' Logon:**
    - Service accounts typically have **elevated privileges** because they need access to sensitive system or application resources.
    - Security measures like **Least Privilege** and **Privileged Access Management** (PAM) are often applied to ensure that service accounts only have the rights they need.
    - Service accounts are often configured to have **non-expiring passwords** or use Managed Service Accounts (MSAs) to avoid disruptions caused by password expiration.

### Summary of Differences:

|Feature|**Normal User Logon**|**Service Account Logon**|
|---|---|---|
|**Logon Type**|Interactive logon|Non-interactive logon|
|**Purpose**|User access to resources|Run services or applications|
|**Ticket Usage**|Short-lived session tickets (TGT, service tickets)|Persistent tickets (TGT) with possible delegation|
|**Password Handling**|Manual password entry|Automated password management (e.g., MSAs) or keytabs|
|**Delegation**|Typically no delegation|Often uses Kerberos delegation (unconstrained or constrained)|
|**Security Policies**|Standard user security (password expiration, complexity)|Special policies (non-expiring passwords, service account permissions)|

In summary, **normal user logon** in Kerberos is geared towards personal, interactive authentication for accessing domain resources, while **service account logon** is designed for non-interactive, automated access to run services and handle tasks, often involving Kerberos delegation and more complex security settings.

Yes, when a **normal user** types their **username and password** at the Windows login screen, the standard **Kerberos authentication** process typically takes place (assuming the system is part of an Active Directory domain and the network supports Kerberos). Here's a more detailed explanation of how this works:

### Kerberos Authentication Process for a Normal User Logon

1. **Credential Entry:**
    
    - The user types their **username** (e.g., `username@domain.com` or `DOMAIN\username`) and **password** on the login screen.
2. **Pre-authentication with Domain Controller:**
    
    - The client machine (your computer) communicates with the **Key Distribution Center (KDC)**, which is a component of the Domain Controller (DC).
    - The KDC has two parts:
        - **Authentication Service (AS)**
        - **Ticket Granting Service (TGS)**
    - The process starts with **pre-authentication**: the user's password is used to generate an encrypted timestamp, which is sent to the KDC. This is done to verify that the user knows their password without directly transmitting it across the network.
3. **Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) Request:**
    
    - If the user's credentials (password) are correct, the **KDC (AS)** returns a **Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT)** to the client.
    - The TGT is encrypted using the KDC's secret key and contains information such as the user’s identity, group memberships, and a timestamp.
    - This TGT is essentially a "proof of identity" that the user will use to request access to specific services.
4. **Service Ticket Request:**
    
    - After the TGT is received, the client can request **service tickets** from the **KDC (TGS)** when attempting to access specific domain services, such as file shares, printers, or applications.
    - The client presents the TGT to the TGS, which verifies it, and then issues a **service ticket** for the resource the user is trying to access.
5. **Access to Resources:**
    
    - The client presents the **service ticket** to the target service (e.g., a file server), which uses it to verify the user's identity.
    - If valid, the user is granted access to the resource, and the session continues.

### Key Points:

- **Kerberos Authentication** is initiated after the user enters their credentials.
- The **password** is used to create an encrypted message (in the pre-authentication phase) that proves the user knows the password without sending it in clear text over the network.
- Once authenticated, the user receives a **TGT**, which is used to get service tickets for accessing various domain resources.
- **Kerberos** provides **single sign-on** (SSO), meaning once you have the TGT, you don't have to re-enter your credentials to access other resources during your session.

### Example in Action:

When you log in to your computer at work (part of an AD domain):

1. You type `johndoe@contoso.com` and your password.
2. Your machine communicates with the AD Domain Controller (KDC), and based on your credentials, it gets a TGT.
3. You try to access a shared folder on another server. Your computer uses the TGT to request a service ticket for that server from the KDC.
4. The server uses the service ticket to verify your identity and grants you access to the shared folder.

So yes, when you enter your **username and password**, **Kerberos authentication** happens in the background to validate your identity and provide access to network resources.

Correct! **Service accounts** don’t manually type passwords like normal users do. Instead, they rely on automated methods for authentication. Here's a detailed breakdown of how **service accounts authenticate** in a **Kerberos environment** without manual password input:

### 1. **Stored Credentials and Password Management**

- **Managed Service Accounts (MSAs)** and **Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSAs)** are commonly used for service accounts in Active Directory environments. These types of accounts have their passwords managed automatically by the system, so no manual intervention is required.

#### Here’s how it works:

- **Managed Service Accounts (MSA):**
    - MSA accounts are used by services to run on individual machines.
    - The system automatically handles password changes at regular intervals (every 30 days by default) without requiring admin intervention.
- **Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA):**
    - gMSA accounts can be used by services running across multiple machines (e.g., a cluster of web servers).
    - The **KDC** in the domain manages the password securely, and the machines running the services can retrieve the current password securely from Active Directory.

In both cases, the password is stored and managed by the system and is never manually entered by a user or administrator.

### 2. **Keytab Files (in non-Windows environments)**

- In **Linux** or **non-Windows environments**, service accounts use **keytab** files. These files contain **encrypted credentials** that allow services to authenticate to Kerberos without requiring a password.
- The keytab file is generated by the **Kerberos administrator** and contains the service’s long-term key (password). The service uses this key to authenticate to the KDC and obtain a **Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT)** just like a user would, but without manual password input.

### 3. **Automatic Logon via Service Configuration**

- In a Windows environment, when you set up a **service** (e.g., SQL Server, IIS), you typically configure it to run under a **service account**.
    - Example: The service is configured to run as `DOMAIN\sqlservice`.
- The service is registered in AD, and its credentials are securely stored in Windows.
- When the service starts, the Windows **Local Security Authority (LSA)** uses the stored credentials to authenticate to the **KDC (Kerberos Key Distribution Center)** to obtain a **TGT** and perform Kerberos authentication **without human intervention**.
- Once the TGT is obtained, the service can request **service tickets** as needed to authenticate to other domain services (like databases, file shares, etc.).

### 4. **How Authentication Works Without Manual Password Entry**

The authentication process follows the same general **Kerberos** flow as a normal user, but here’s what changes for service accounts:

- **Pre-Authentication:**
    - Instead of typing a password, the system or application running under the service account will either use **MSA/gMSA** (which retrieves the password automatically) or a **keytab file** (for non-Windows systems) to initiate Kerberos authentication.
- **Requesting a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT):**
    - The service sends an authentication request to the KDC.
    - For **MSA/gMSA**, Windows automatically handles the password and encrypts a timestamp for the pre-authentication phase.
    - For **keytab files**, the stored key (password) is used to encrypt the request.
    - The **KDC** verifies the credentials and sends back a **TGT** to the service account.
- **Service Ticket Request:**
    - With the TGT in hand, the service can now request **service tickets** to access other resources on the network (e.g., databases, file servers).
    - The process works exactly the same as for normal users, except that it's happening in the background automatically.

### 5. **Kerberos Delegation and Service Accounts**

- Many service accounts are also configured for **Kerberos delegation**, meaning they can authenticate on behalf of a user to another service (common in web applications or proxy servers).
- Delegation types:
    - **Unconstrained Delegation:** Allows the service account to act on behalf of the user to any service.
    - **Constrained Delegation:** Limits the services that the service account can impersonate a user for, providing more security.

### Example: SQL Server Service Account Using Kerberos

Let’s say you have a **SQL Server** running on a Windows server that uses a **gMSA** (`SQLSvcAccount`). Here’s how authentication works:

1. **Account Setup:**
    
    - The **SQL Server** is configured to run under the **SQLSvcAccount**, a gMSA.
    - The password for this account is managed by Active Directory, and it changes automatically as needed without admin intervention.
2. **Service Start:**
    
    - When the **SQL Server** starts, the system automatically retrieves the current password for `SQLSvcAccount` from Active Directory.
    - The service authenticates to the **KDC** and gets a **TGT** for `SQLSvcAccount` without manual password input.
3. **Resource Access:**
    
    - When the **SQL Server** needs to access another service (like a file server), it uses the TGT to request a **service ticket** from the KDC.
    - The service ticket allows SQL Server to authenticate to the file server and access the necessary resources.

### Summary of How Service Accounts Authenticate without Manual Passwords:

1. **Managed Service Accounts (MSA/gMSA):**
    
    - The system automatically handles the password for the service account and securely authenticates to Kerberos without needing user input.
2. **Keytab Files (non-Windows):**
    
    - Services use keytab files to securely store credentials and authenticate to the KDC without requiring a password entry.
3. **Pre-configured Credentials:**
    
    - Services on Windows machines can run under a service account, and the **Local Security Authority (LSA)** or system handles the authentication process automatically.
4. **Automatic Ticket Generation:**
    
    - Once authenticated, the service obtains a **Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT)** and can request service tickets to access other network resources.

By using these mechanisms, service accounts can continuously run services or applications and authenticate to other resources securely without needing to manually enter passwords.
