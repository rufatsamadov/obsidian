Here are some challenges based on the commands from your PowerShell lab. These will test your understanding and help you think more critically about how to use PowerShell.

### Challenge 1: Advanced File Management

- **Objective**: Create, move, rename, and delete files using PowerShell.
    - Create 5 new text files in a directory called `ChallengeFiles` on your desktop.
    - Move 3 of those files to a subdirectory called `MovedFiles` inside `ChallengeFiles`.
    - Rename the remaining 2 files with a timestamp (e.g., `File_20240926.txt`).
    - Delete the `MovedFiles` directory and all its contents.
    - **Bonus**: Write a PowerShell script that automates the entire process.

### Challenge 2: Analyzing Processes

- **Objective**: Analyze the processes running on your system using cmdlets like `Get-Process` and `Sort-Object`.
    - Display the top 5 processes consuming the most memory (VM).
    - Find the process with the highest CPU usage and display its name and ID.
    - Stop a process of your choice (by name or ID) that is not essential (be careful not to close critical processes like `explorer.exe`).
    - **Bonus**: Automate this process analysis with a script that generates a report and saves it as a text file.

### Challenge 3: Pipeline Mastery

- **Objective**: Use pipelines effectively to filter and sort data.
    - List all services on your system and filter out the ones that are not running.
    - Sort the running services by their **DisplayName** and output only the first 10 results.
    - **Bonus**: Export the results to a CSV file, including **Name**, **Status**, and **DisplayName** columns.

### Challenge 4: Get-Help Deep Dive

- **Objective**: Master the `Get-Help` command to explore cmdlets you haven’t used before.
    - Use `Get-Help` to find a cmdlet that can copy items in PowerShell. Copy a file of your choice to another location.
    - Find the full syntax of the `Stop-Service` cmdlet and use it to stop a non-critical service (e.g., `Spooler`).
    - **Bonus**: Find a cmdlet that you haven't used before, run it, and explain what it does.

### Challenge 5: Text and CSV Manipulation

- **Objective**: Manipulate data from text and CSV files.
    - Create a CSV file with at least 5 rows containing user information (Name, Age, Email).
    - Write a script to read the file, and for each user, output their name in uppercase if they are older than 25.
    - **Bonus**: Append new data to the CSV and ensure that the CSV formatting remains intact.

### Challenge 6: Combining Commands in Complex Pipelines

- **Objective**: Combine multiple cmdlets to solve complex problems.
    - Create a list of all files in the `C:\Windows` directory, then filter out files that are larger than 1MB and sort them by size.
    - Find all services on your machine that are in the "Running" state, sort them by **Name**, and format the output in a neatly aligned table with **Status** and **DisplayName**.
    - **Bonus**: Write a pipeline that takes the top 5 largest files from your home directory, renames them by appending `_large` to their filename, and moves them to a new directory called `LargeFiles`.

### Challenge 7: Script Automation

- **Objective**: Automate repetitive tasks using PowerShell scripting.
    - Write a script that backs up all `.txt` files from a directory of your choice to a folder called `Backup`. Ensure the script:
        - Creates the backup folder if it doesn’t exist.
        - Appends the current date to the backup folder name.
        - Moves the `.txt` files, keeping their directory structure intact.
    - **Bonus**: Make the script log the operations (e.g., file moved, timestamp) into a separate log file.

These challenges should give you a practical way to dive deeper into PowerShell while reinforcing the concepts you've been learning. Let me know how it goes or if you need hints!
