The command names are changing by the time(version) that's why it is important to know which version of powershell you are using as a hacker

`1.Objectives In this lab, the student will gain an understanding of the PowerShell Variables, User Input, and Console Output. 1.1. Tasks 1. Working With Variables: If you want to query the type of data a variable contains, you can do so with the Get-Member cmdlet. Get-Member also displays the variable's properties and methods. For example, variables of the System.String type have the ToUpper() method, which converts the content of the variable to uppercase. $server.ToUpper() LOCALHOST 2. To create a new variable, use an assignment statement to assign a value to the variable. You don't have to declare the variable before using it. The default value of all variables is $null $MyVariable = 1, 2, 3 $Path = "C:\Windows\System32" 3. Variables are useful for storing the results of commands. For example: $Processes = Get-Process $Today = (Get-Date).DateTime To change the value of a variable, assign a new value to the variable. LAB 2.1 3 1.2. Casting 1 To use cast notation, enter a type name, enclosed in brackets, before the variable name (on the left side of the assignment statement). # If no casting the number will be concatenated instead of multiplied
PS> [int]$num = read-host "Enter any number:" Enter any number: 1024 PS> $num = $num * 10 
PS> $num 10240 2. Using Variables in Commands and Expressions To use a variable in a command or expression, type the variable name, preceded by the dollar ($) sign. 
PS> $var = 'Hello' PS> $var = 'The content of the variable is $var' 
PS> $var The content of the variable is $var 3. The single quotes prevent the $ sign from being interpreted as the start of a variable name. 
PS> $var = 'Hello' PS> $var="Variable contains $var" 
PS> $var Variable contains Hello LAB 2.1 4 4. The backtick  causes Powershell to ignore the meaning of the following special character, for example: 
PS> $var = 'Hello' 
PS> $var="Variable $var contains $var" 
PS> $var The variable $var contains Hello 5. It can also be used to give special meaning to certain characters (equivalent to \ in C and Java, for example \n, \t...). 
PS> $computername = 'localhost' 
PS> $phrase = "`$computernamencontainsn$computername" 
PS> $phrase $computername contains localhost 6. It is possible to create a list type variable, separating the values of the list with commas: 
PS> $computers = 'server', 'localhost', 'server_2' 
PS> $computers server localhost server_2 LAB 2.1 5 7. List elements can be accessed by index number. Lists are numbered from zero: 
PS> $computers[0] server 
PS> $computers.count 3 8. It is also possible to iterate over a list using the Foreach-Object cmdlet. These two commands do the same thing: $computers = $computers.tolower() $computers = $computers | ForEach-Object {$_.tolower()}`
