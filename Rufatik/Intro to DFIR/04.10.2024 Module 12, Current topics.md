GDPR=Law
If you are analysing a disk and this disk contains PCI DSS data it means you put your company at risk because youve collected PCI data and moved to the place that is not PCI certified
That's why you have to extremely careful when collecting data



***

When collecting personal data from citizens of the European Union (EU), one of the biggest risks you face is **non-compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**, which is a strict privacy and security law enforced in the EU. Non-compliance can result in heavy fines and significant legal, reputational, and operational consequences. Here are the main risks associated with processing EU citizens' personal data:

### 1. **Fines and Penalties**
   - **Administrative Fines**: GDPR has two levels of fines:
     - Up to **€10 million** or 2% of global annual turnover (whichever is higher) for less severe violations.
     - Up to **€20 million** or 4% of global annual turnover (whichever is higher) for more severe violations, such as failing to obtain valid consent or not protecting data.
   - These fines can be crippling for both small businesses and large enterprises.

### 2. **Legal Risks**
   - **Lawsuits**: Individuals whose data has been mishandled have the right to file lawsuits against your organization. This can include claims for **compensation** in cases where personal data breaches lead to harm.
   - **Breach Notification Failures**: Failing to notify the authorities and affected individuals within 72 hours of discovering a data breach can result in additional penalties.

### 3. **Reputational Damage**
   - **Loss of Trust**: Mishandling personal data, such as exposing it in a breach or failing to respect privacy rights, can severely damage your company's reputation. This can result in loss of customers and business partners.
   - **Public Relations Crisis**: News of non-compliance or a data breach could result in negative media attention, which is hard to recover from.

### 4. **Operational and Business Disruption**
   - **Business Interruptions**: In the event of a breach, the authorities may order you to stop processing data, resulting in business downtime.
   - **Data Processing Limitations**: GDPR imposes strict rules on how personal data can be collected, used, stored, and transferred. Non-compliance can result in restrictions on your ability to process or store personal data, hampering your business activities.

### 5. **Data Subject Rights Violations**
   - GDPR grants individuals specific rights, and failure to comply with these rights can lead to significant risks. These include:
     - **Right to Access**: Individuals can request a copy of their personal data. Failure to provide this within one month could lead to fines.
     - **Right to Be Forgotten**: Individuals can request the deletion of their personal data. Non-compliance with this request could lead to severe penalties.
     - **Right to Data Portability**: Users can request that their data be transferred to another service provider. Not complying can violate GDPR regulations.
     - **Right to Object**: Individuals have the right to object to the processing of their personal data in certain circumstances, such as for marketing purposes.

### 6. **Security Risks**
   - **Data Breaches**: GDPR requires that personal data be handled with the utmost security, using encryption, pseudonymization, and other protective measures. Failure to implement strong data security protocols can lead to breaches, resulting in both regulatory penalties and customer loss.
   - **Insufficient Data Access Controls**: Failure to limit access to personal data on a need-to-know basis could expose you to internal threats, such as unauthorized employees accessing sensitive data.

### 7. **Non-compliance with International Data Transfers**
   - **Transfers Outside the EU**: GDPR imposes strict conditions on transferring personal data outside of the EU (to non-EU/EEA countries). If your organization transfers data to countries not deemed to have adequate data protection laws, you must implement additional safeguards (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses). Failing to follow these regulations can result in penalties.

### 8. **Lack of Transparency and Consent Issues**
   - **Unclear Privacy Policies**: GDPR mandates clear and transparent communication with data subjects regarding what personal data is being collected, how it will be used, and for what purpose. If your privacy policy is ambiguous or incomplete, this could lead to non-compliance.
   - **Invalid Consent**: Collecting personal data without explicit and informed consent (where necessary) can lead to GDPR violations. Consent must be specific, freely given, and revocable at any time.

### 9. **Data Processing Agreements**
   - If you share personal data with third parties (e.g., cloud providers, marketing services), GDPR requires that you have proper **Data Processing Agreements (DPAs)** in place. Failing to establish these agreements or ensure third-party compliance exposes you to liability for data misuse.

### 10. **Non-Compliance with Record-Keeping and Accountability**
   - Under GDPR, organizations must demonstrate their compliance by maintaining records of data processing activities and conducting impact assessments (for high-risk processing). If you fail to document these processes, it can be viewed as non-compliance, even if no data breach occurs.

### Mitigating the Risks
- **Data Minimization**: Only collect and process data that is necessary for your operations.
- **Security Measures**: Implement strong encryption, secure data storage, and access control.
- **Data Subject Rights**: Ensure your organization has a system in place to respond to data subject requests.
- **GDPR Compliance Program**: Establish a GDPR compliance team or officer (if required) and make GDPR compliance part of your regular operations.
- **Review Contracts with Third Parties**: Ensure your contracts with processors or service providers include GDPR-compliant clauses.

By being proactive in ensuring compliance with GDPR, you can reduce the risk of penalties and other negative outcomes.

**PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)** is a set of security standards designed to ensure that all companies that process, store, or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment. Non-compliance with PCI DSS can result in significant risks, particularly when handling cardholder data (CHD) or sensitive authentication data (SAD).

### Key Risks of Non-Compliance with PCI DSS:

### 1. **Financial Penalties**

- **Fines**: Non-compliance can lead to fines imposed by payment card brands (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, etc.). These fines can range from $5,000 to $100,000 per month, depending on the severity and duration of the violation.
- **Increased Transaction Fees**: Payment processors may impose higher fees for transactions, or they may terminate your ability to process credit card payments altogether.
- **Liability for Fraudulent Transactions**: In the event of a data breach, you may be liable for fraudulent transactions made using stolen cardholder data.

### 2. **Data Breaches**

- **Security Breaches**: PCI DSS compliance mandates strict data security controls, such as encryption and access management. Failure to comply increases the risk of cyberattacks and data breaches, which can lead to the exposure of sensitive payment card data.
- **Legal Action**: If cardholder data is compromised, your organization may face lawsuits from affected individuals or businesses. This can result in costly legal fees and settlements.
- **Compensating Controls Failures**: If you do not implement the required security measures, compensating controls must be established and documented. Failure to implement or validate these can lead to vulnerabilities.

### 3. **Reputational Damage**

- **Loss of Trust**: Customers expect their payment data to be secure. A data breach or exposure of cardholder data can severely damage your reputation and lead to the loss of current and potential customers.
- **Public Relations Fallout**: Similar to GDPR non-compliance, a PCI DSS-related incident (e.g., a breach) can result in negative media coverage and a loss of public confidence in your brand.

### 4. **Operational Costs**

- **Remediation Costs**: In the event of non-compliance or a breach, you may have to spend significant resources on remediation efforts. This could include upgrading security measures, conducting forensic investigations, and repairing systems that were compromised.
- **Payment Processing Suspension**: Payment card brands or banks may suspend your ability to process payments if you're found to be non-compliant, which can directly impact revenue and day-to-day business operations.

### 5. **Mandatory Forensic Investigations**

- **In the Event of a Breach**: If a breach occurs and you are found to be non-compliant, the card brands will typically require a forensic investigation. This investigation can be expensive, and your business may be held responsible for the costs.
- **PCI Forensic Investigator (PFI)**: A PFI may be required to validate compliance after a breach. These investigations are extensive and can be disruptive to operations.

### 6. **Cardholder Data Loss**

- **Exposed Cardholder Data (CHD)**: PCI DSS mandates specific controls for protecting cardholder data, such as:
    - Encrypting transmission of CHD over public networks.
    - Ensuring PAN (Primary Account Number) is masked or truncated when displayed.
    - Implementing access control measures to limit who can access cardholder data.
- If these protections are not in place, it could lead to the exposure of CHD, increasing the likelihood of fraudulent activity.

### 7. **Loss of Merchant Account**

- **Revocation of Payment Processing Privileges**: If a business is non-compliant or has repeated breaches, credit card companies or acquiring banks may revoke their merchant account. This would make it impossible for the business to accept card payments, significantly disrupting business operations.

### 8. **Legal and Regulatory Risk**

- **Lawsuits**: A breach that leads to the loss of cardholder data can result in lawsuits from affected customers, partners, or credit card companies. Legal action can be costly and time-consuming.
- **Non-Compliance with Local Laws**: Many countries and regions have their own data protection and breach notification laws (such as GDPR in Europe or CCPA in California). Non-compliance with PCI DSS may result in violations of these laws, leading to legal consequences on multiple fronts.

### 9. **Third-Party Risk**

- **Vulnerabilities from Service Providers**: If your business uses third-party service providers (such as cloud hosting or payment gateways) that handle payment card data, PCI DSS requires that they also be compliant. If your third-party provider is non-compliant, it exposes you to risk as well.
- **Shared Liability**: While your organization may not directly handle cardholder data, if your service providers are not PCI DSS-compliant, you may be held accountable in the event of a breach.

### 10. **Complex Audits and Assessments**

- **Costly Assessments**: If you handle a high volume of card transactions, you may be required to undergo an annual **PCI DSS assessment** conducted by a **Qualified Security Assessor (QSA)**. These assessments can be costly and complex.
- **Self-Assessment Challenges**: For smaller businesses, completing the required **Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ)** and conducting vulnerability scans can be time-consuming. Non-compliance with these processes increases the risk of data breaches.

### Key Requirements of PCI DSS:

To avoid the risks above, organizations must ensure they meet the key PCI DSS requirements, including:

1. **Build and Maintain a Secure Network and Systems**:
    
    - Install and maintain a firewall configuration to protect cardholder data.
    - Do not use vendor-supplied defaults for system passwords and other security parameters.
2. **Protect Cardholder Data**:
    
    - Protect stored cardholder data.
    - Encrypt transmission of cardholder data across open, public networks.
3. **Maintain a Vulnerability Management Program**:
    
    - Protect all systems against malware and regularly update anti-virus software.
    - Develop and maintain secure systems and applications.
4. **Implement Strong Access Control Measures**:
    
    - Restrict access to cardholder data to only those who need to know.
    - Assign a unique ID to each person with computer access.
    - Restrict physical access to cardholder data.
5. **Regularly Monitor and Test Networks**:
    
    - Track and monitor all access to network resources and cardholder data.
    - Regularly test security systems and processes.
6. **Maintain an Information Security Policy**:
    
    - Maintain a policy that addresses information security for employees and contractors.
