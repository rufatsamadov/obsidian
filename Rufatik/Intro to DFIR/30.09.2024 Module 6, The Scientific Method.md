The terms **theorem** and **hypothesis** are both used in reasoning and science, but they refer to different concepts.

### **1. Theorem**:

- **Definition**: A **theorem** is a statement that has been proven to be true based on logical reasoning and previously established facts or axioms.
- **Nature**: It is **proven**. Theorems are typically found in mathematics, logic, and formal sciences.
- **Proof**: A theorem must be accompanied by a formal **proof**, which demonstrates that the theorem is valid under the given assumptions.
- **Example**: 
   - **Pythagorean Theorem**: In a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
   - This is a proven statement with a rigorous mathematical proof.

### **2. Hypothesis**:

- **Definition**: A **hypothesis** is a proposed explanation or prediction about a phenomenon that is not yet proven but can be tested through experimentation or observation.
- **Nature**: It is **unproven** and serves as a starting point for investigation. Hypotheses are often used in the scientific method.
- **Testing**: A hypothesis must be **tested** through experiments, observations, or further research to determine whether it is valid or should be rejected.
- **Example**:
   - **Hypothesis**: "Increasing the amount of sunlight will increase plant growth."
   - This is a testable idea, but it requires experiments to prove or disprove it.

### Key Differences:
| Aspect           | Theorem                               | Hypothesis                            |
|------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Definition**   | Proven statement based on logic       | Proposed explanation or prediction    |
| **Proof**        | Requires formal proof                 | Requires experimentation/testing      |
| **Certainty**    | Proven to be true                     | Unproven and testable                 |
| **Field**        | Primarily used in mathematics and logic| Used in science and general research  |
| **Example**      | Pythagorean Theorem                   | "If I water the plant daily, it will grow faster."|

In summary, a **theorem** is a statement that has been **proven** true, while a **hypothesis** is a **testable assumption** or idea that may or may not be proven true through further research.
