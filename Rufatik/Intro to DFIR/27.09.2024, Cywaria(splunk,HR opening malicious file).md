    - **Event ID 4624**: An account was successfully logged on.
    - **Event ID 4688**: A new process has been created.
- **Use**: Helps administrators and security analysts quickly identify what type of event occurred. It’s a key reference for searching logs or identifying specific activities.

### 2. **Event Type**

- **Purpose**: Describes the general category of the event based on its severity or impact.
- **Role**: Defines the nature or urgency of the event in terms of system operation. Windows event types typically include informational, warning, and error messages.
- **Common Event Types**:
    - **Information**: Non-critical events that report successful operations or regular activities.
    - **Warning**: Indicates a potential issue that isn’t critical yet but may require attention.
    - **Error**: Indicates a significant problem, such as hardware failure or system malfunction.
    - **Audit Success/Failure**: (In security logs) Represents whether an action (e.g., login attempt) was successful or failed.

### Key Differences:

- **Event ID** is a specific, fixed number assigned to a particular event type or action.
- **Event Type** describes the nature of the event (informational, warning, error) and gives context to the severity or importance of the event.

if a hacker created a new file in our system what its event id should be in our logs?

###### ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

If a hacker created a new file on your system, several logs could potentially capture this activity, depending on what tools or auditing configurations you have in place. The specific **Event ID** in your logs depends on the tool being used. Here's a breakdown of the most common scenarios:

### **1. Windows Security Logs (with File Auditing Enabled)**

When **File Auditing** is enabled on a Windows system, you can monitor file creation activity, which typically triggers **Event ID 4663**:

- **Event ID 4663**: **An attempt was made to access an object** (File Creation)
    - This event is logged when a new file is created, modified, or deleted. To track file creation, the event will specify the **"WriteData"** or **"AppendData"** permission under the **Accesses** field.
    - **Key Fields**:
        - **Object Name**: The path to the file that was created.
        - **Process Name**: The process that accessed the object.
        - **Subject**: The account that performed the action.

### **2. Sysmon Logs**

If **Sysmon** is running and logging file activity, the relevant Event ID would be **Sysmon Event ID 11**:

- **Sysmon Event ID 11**: **File Creation**
    - This event is logged whenever a file is created or overwritten. It includes details such as:
        - **File path**
        - **Process ID** that created the file
        - **Hashes** (if configured) of the file for integrity and malware analysis.

### **3. Windows Event Log for Process Creation**

If the hacker used a process to create the file, you might also see **Event ID 4688**:

- **Event ID 4688**: **A new process has been created**
    - If a new process was created to drop or create a file (e.g., a malicious script), this event logs the creation of that process, including the command line used to execute it.

### **4. PowerShell Logging (if the attack used PowerShell)**

If the hacker used **PowerShell** to create a file, the logs could capture:

- **Event ID 4104**: **Script Block Logging**
    - Logs the content of PowerShell scripts and could include file creation commands.
- **Event ID 4688**: If PowerShell spawned as a new process.

### Summary:

- **Windows Security Logs (Event ID 4663)**: Logs file access, including creation.
- **Sysmon (Event ID 11)**: Tracks file creation with more detailed forensic data.
- **Windows Security (Event ID 4688)**: Tracks process creation, which could indicate a file was dropped via a script or malware.

You can use these event logs together to trace the steps of the hacker and investigate the exact method and timing of the file creation.
