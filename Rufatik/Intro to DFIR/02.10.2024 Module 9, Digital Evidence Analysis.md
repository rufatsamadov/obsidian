Snort has 2 alert modes full and fast(1 line)
Cisco Talos provides us with free snort rules

==[1:2009702:5]==
==[ what triggers the alert(e.g rules):rule id:revision id(version number of the rule)]==
cat alert | grep \'\^\[\*\*\].\*\[\*\*\]\$\'   -> to bring all alert names
![[Pasted image 20241002140802.png]]
\[\*\*\]=nose of the pig that represents mascott of snort
grep=generic regular expression pattern

Analysing the number of alerts:

Rare alerts are "quwlamag" of our adversary
admin$=hidden admin share in SMB (dollar sign makes it hidden)
In our case it is GPL NETBIOS SMB IPC$
Old windows systems use port 139 for SMB
We look at the events of interests:

\*\*\*AP\*\*\* means ACK and PUSH bits are set

We can look a little deeper by recovering the offending packets by extracting them from snort’s tcpdump log
We use wireshark to read the SMB hex

What we can observe in the above Wireshark screenshot is what appears to be an SMB fragment—fragments that can appear out-of-order. SMB requires a 4-way handshake: Dialect Negotiation, Session Setup, Tree Connect, and Resource Access. We appear to be seeing the request for a Tree Connect but it is the “AndX” without a specification of what the subsequent Resource Access request is. This is not truly abnormal based on the complexities of SMB. But we simply can’t see from this one packet what preceded or is to follow. In any case at this point in the SMB stream we’re seeing the last stage before Resource Access. We have already ascertained that 10.233.233.202 is compromised, and it seems likely that 10.233.233.234 is about to be as well—if it hasn’t already been.

We make the USB flash drive read-only because we do not want its contents to change because it is an evidence
But in Tsurugi it uses software write blocker (more strong way)
dd command copy data in linux
dcfldd same as dd but a lot more faster
conv=sync-when it hits bad sector it just writes same amount of null data to avoid errors
noerror-when it hits bad sector it doesnt give us an error
***
Splunk parses all kinds of logs so it is expensive
But ELK cant parse all kinds of logs
"Dirty word lists"=list of strings that we should search those strings when investigating because bad guys use bad words
PCRE=perl compatible reg ex
RAT=remote administration tool
FOG server=With this tool mac,windows,linux machines can easily be managed by a remote server(it's like AD but linux doesnt support AD so we use FOG)
If an IP connects to another IP first time using a FOG server then it is strongly a threat
Details of our report=1.5 page for attorney and layer 9 and should be explainable to ones that has zero knowledge about the field
Surprise evidences doesn't work
Each side has to have access to evidence
SMB requires four way handshake:Dialect Negotiation, Session Setup, Tree Connect, and Resource Access
