If a system is compromised it means its behaviour 100% will change
If we dont log things,we should start doing it even we are in the middle of the incident maybe the adversary still there
Timestamps sometimes is not synchronized in desktop devices(but it must be)
EOI=Someone outside scanning our network
IOC=Someone inside scanning our network
Indicatos of Campaign=Actions on objectives
Indicators of Subversion=Changing something's purpose(undermine) Bot in a Botnet is a subversion
MAC=1)modification 2)access 3)change
1)modification of metadata
2)accessing file content
3)changing file content
If you see a port that comes lots of traffic  and google is not certain about the port's service then the port is evil

==399 bytes every 5 seconds=beaconing==
==icmp,http,dns=most common protocols for c2==
==there is uid value in http log that is got from conn.log like foreign key in relational db==

We see that all 13435 go to port 5000 and all of them is http

We see 39k and 45k bytes from the responder(evil) that says to our machine i have smth for you(malware)
We look at the timestamp of 44k and 39k bytes coming and after that we observe the compromised system to see anomalies after that timestamp
Blue teamers most of the time cover vertical compromises,but adversaries use horizontal to make it undetectable
