Like gratituous ARP there's gratutious dns as well and the purpose of these are to reduce overwhelming.
If ECN-Echo is gon be used it is negotiated with client and server.
After doing 3 way handshake if the first packet is encrypted then this is evil.
I mean after syn,syn/ack,ack process if  cipher traffic comes first(there's no tls negotiation) it means that bad guys have keys to decrypt the traffic.
tcpdump -n technion.pcap - without -n flag tcpdump will try to resolve numbers to names (reverse dns) meanwhile our OS will send bunch of dns queries which is also not a good thing.
