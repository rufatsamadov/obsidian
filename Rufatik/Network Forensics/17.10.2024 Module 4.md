tcpdump -n -r Technion1.pcap 'tcp\[\1\3\]\=0x12'
this query helps us to find the segments with syn and ack bit set.

tcpdump -n -r Technion1.pcap '(tcp\[\1\3\] \& 0x3f) = 0x12' 
here 0x3f is a mask and equals to 00111111 and we ignore first 2 bits which are E and C flags on tcp segment.After that we compare them to 0x12 which is 00010010 in binary to find all the segments that syn and ack flags set no matter their E and C flags are set or not.
ACK flag=(.) in the tcpdump.
C flag=W in the tcpdump.
MF bit=more fragment.
